# Sources

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). Additional modifications:

- removed testing framework from create-react-app setup
- create styles and components folders within src folder
- created jsconfig.json file to set baseUrl for absolute imports e.g. `import "styles/index.css"`
